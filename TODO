- Fix "run" function in hooks.py to log error rather than exiting silently (exceptions emitted at INFO level)
- Pick a better way to get machine specs than hacky bash functions - facter?

- Specify usernames when adding a relation, rather than generating them
  automagically. This will interact better with connection poolers.

- Make config_changed issue a 'reload' instead of a 'restart' when
  possible, improving availability.

- If we have three services deployed, related via master/slave, then the
  repmgr command line tools only work on the service containing the master
  unit, as the slave-only services have neither ssh nor postgresql access
  to each other. This may only be a problem with master/slave relationships
  between services and failover, and it is unclear how that would work
  anyway (get failover working fist for units within a service).

- Should the cluster_name really be configurable? Just name the cluster
  after the unit to avoid conflicts.
