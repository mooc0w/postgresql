- Fix "run" function in hooks.py to log error rather than exiting silently (exceptions emitted at INFO level)
- Pick a better way to get machine specs than hacky bash functions - facter?

- Specify usernames when adding a relation, rather than generating them
  automagically. This will interact better with connection poolers.

- Make config_changed issue a 'reload' instead of a 'restart' when
  possible, improving availability.
